# Document Parser – JavaScript

Simple JavaScript tool to parse structured information from documents and export the data in CSV format.

## Features
- Parses delivery note–style documents
- Extracts key fields (date, product, quantity, reference)
- Converts structured data into CSV
- Clean and readable JavaScript code
- Designed for automation and data processing use cases

## Use Case
This project demonstrates how document parsing logic can be implemented using JavaScript.
It simulates real-world scenarios such as processing delivery notes, invoices, or reports
to reduce manual data entry and improve efficiency.

## Technologies
- JavaScript (Node.js compatible)
- CSV data formatting
- Automation logic

## How It Works
1. Input: Document text (simulated)
2. Parsing logic extracts relevant fields
3. Data is converted into CSV format
4. Output is printed to the console

## Example Output
```csv
date,product,quantity,reference
2025-01-10,Sample Product,10,REF-001
